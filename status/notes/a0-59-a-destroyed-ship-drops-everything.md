# a0-59 — a destroyed ship drops everything

Branch `agent/gameplay/a0-59-full-death-drop`, **based on `a0-58` (PR #433, open)**,
not on `main`. Read the BASE section before touching anything.

## BASE — why this branch is stacked

a0-58 (`agent/gameplay/a0-58-whole-ore-only`) was pushed but **not merged** when
this started. The brief says rebase on it rather than race it, so this branch was
cut from a0-58's tip (`6044fca`) and carries its 14 commits underneath its own.
Consequences to know:

- `git diff main..HEAD` shows a0-58's whole diff plus mine, and shows a few
  `sound-review/` files as "reverted" — that is the merge-base, not a revert. a0-58
  branched before the a0-57 sound merge. **Do not "fix" that by reverting anything.**
- If a0-58 merges first, this PR collapses to my delta on its own.
- If a0-58 is ever abandoned, this branch still needs its whole-ore commits: the
  invariant is deliberately kept (see DECISIONS).

## BUILT

- `97a27f4` **sim(a0-59)** — `DEATH_ORE_DROP_FRACTION: Tunable<number> = 1`
  (`src/sim/constants.ts`), the ruling quoted verbatim on the constant.
  - `src/sim/damage.ts` — every comment that said "half" now says what happens.
    The code itself did not need to change: `drop = held * fraction` and a0-58's
    whole-chunk split already produce `drop = held`, all whole, `deathLoss = 0`.
  - `src/sim/damage.test.ts` — **`drops the whole hold`** (the DoD's named test):
    N = 1..9, chunks summing to exactly N, `toBe`-exact, plus `deathLoss === 0`.
    Beside it: the ledger balance (`dropped + deathLoss === held`) and the
    sub-chunk floor. a0-58's five tests are kept and renamed off "half".
  - `src/sim/loot-tell.test.ts`, `src/sim/match.test.ts` — the three assertions
    that encoded 0.5.
  - `GDD.md` §2.3 / §2.7 / §2.8 amended; `docs/design-amendments.md` carries the
    full entry with the developer's sentence verbatim.
- `586f479` **docs(a0-59)** — the sweep: `content/codex/codex-systems.json` (the
  in-game codex was telling players they drop half; the fact value is pinned to
  the constant by `tests/codex/codex-constants.test.ts`), `docs/gdd-conformance.md`,
  `docs/progression-plan.md`, `tests/harness/a0-08-evidence.test.ts` and the
  regenerated `evidence/a0-08-loot-tell/trace.txt`.

## DECISIONS

**Kept a0-58's whole-ore invariant, which this brief mostly dissolves.** At a
fraction of 1 the drop equals the hold and a whole hold divides into whole chunks
with nothing over, so the rounding subtracts zero today. It stays because both
`DEATH_ORE_DROP_FRACTION` and `CHUNK.ore` are TUNABLE and either one moving off 1
re-mints the remainder in one edit. LESSONS §26 — assert the relationship, not
today's value. **Do not delete the `pieces = Math.floor(...)` split because it
currently rounds nothing.**

**Kept `deathLoss`, now 0 for an ordinary death.** Explicitly required by the DoD.
It is the sink for anything undropped (quantisation leftover, ore lost out of
bounds) and `expectedLiveOre` subtracts it either way; a zero term costs nothing,
an absent term costs the conservation law.

**Rejected: touching `killShip`'s logic.** The one-line constant is the whole
mechanical change. Anything else would be scope the developer did not ask for.

**Rejected: hardcoding 1 in the tests.** Every assertion except `drops the whole
hold` reads `DEATH_ORE_DROP_FRACTION` / `CHUNK.ore`, so a future tune moves them
honestly instead of failing for the wrong reason. `drops the whole hold` is the
one place the *value* is the point, and is exact there on purpose.

**Removed the victim's bought cargo tier in two staging helpers**
(`src/sim/loot-tell.test.ts`, `tests/harness/a0-08-evidence.test.ts`) rather than
raising the looter's hold. Both tiers existed only so the *half*-drop would shed
2 chunks; the base hold of 2 now sheds 2 by itself. This keeps the a0-08 three-way
comparison honest — the looter's hold stays the only thing that varies. Worth
knowing: with a whole-hold drop a wreck can now out-size its looter (a tiered
victim sheds 4 into a base hold of 2), which is a real a0-59 consequence and is
noted in the test comment, not hidden.

**Flagged, not decided: the balance re-measure.** §2.8's field-yield, abundance
and collapse numbers were tuned with a sink that no longer exists. Stated as a
change in the amendment and the PR body; measuring it is QA's call, not this
lane's.

## NEXT

- Determinism goldens: `src/bots/ffa-parity.test.ts` (3 seeds) and
  `tests/net/online-radio.test.ts` `FFA_GOLDEN` pin absolute state hashes of the
  simulation, so a sim rule change moves them by construction — same four a0-58
  moved. **`src/bots/` is not this lane's to edit.** Cross-lane, in their own
  commits, flagged in the PR to Bot and Netcode, old values kept, exactly as a0-58
  did it. Status: see the commits after `586f479`.
- Full `npx vitest --run` and `npx tsc --noEmit` green before the PR opens.

## BLOCKERS

None.
