/**
 * tests/mobile/goldens.spec.ts — GOLDEN-SCENE screenshots. OWNER: QA Agent.
 *
 * Deterministic visual baselines of the real preview build under
 * `?debug=1&freeze=1`. `?freeze=1` pins the seeded sim at a fixed tick
 * (freeze.ts) and the renderer is a pure function of that world — nothing
 * animates off the wall clock (spawn protection is a static alpha, the wave/ore
 * flashes derive from the frozen `world.time`) — so the same frame is drawn on
 * every boot and machine. That determinism is what lets us diff the whole frame
 * with NOTHING masked (per brief) and still be stable; the only residual noise
 * is font/GPU antialiasing, which the small `maxDiffPixelRatio` tolerates.
 *
 * Two baselines, per brief: the desktop control and one landscape phone. Each
 * test is gated to a single project so exactly one baseline is generated for it
 * (Playwright already suffixes the snapshot name with project + platform).
 *
 * Regenerate after an intentional visual change with:
 *   npx playwright test tests/mobile/goldens.spec.ts --update-snapshots
